## Development

1. This library uses `yalc` to manage local dependencies. You will need to clone the `pt-v5-utils-js-beta` repo and publish it with `yalc` (you can publish it using `yarn start` after `yarn install` in the `pt-v5-utils-js-beta` directory).

2. Following that, make sure to run `yarn yalcadd` before installing to setup local dependencies.

3. Finally, run `yarn install` in the root of this package. You can now run `yarn start` in any of the subpackages.
